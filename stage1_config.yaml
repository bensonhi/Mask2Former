# Stage 1 Configuration: Algorithmic Annotations Training
# Based on Swin-Base config optimized for large dataset with algorithmic annotations
# 
# STAGE 1 DATASET: ~100 images with algorithmic annotations from batch processing
# - Training: 3000 iterations for robust feature learning
# - Conservative learning rate for stable training on noisy annotations
# - Focus on learning general myotube features
