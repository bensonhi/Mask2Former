# Stage 1 Configuration: Algorithmic Annotations Training
# Based on Swin-Large config optimized for large dataset with algorithmic annotations
# 
# STAGE 1 DATASET: ~90 images with algorithmic annotations from batch processing
# - Training: 18,000 iterations for robust feature learning
# - Evaluation: Manual test set for realistic performance assessment
# - Focus on learning general myotube features that transfer well to manual quality
