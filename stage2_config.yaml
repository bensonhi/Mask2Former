# Stage 2 Configuration: Manual Annotations Fine-tuning
# Fine-tuning config for high-quality manual annotations
# 
# STAGE 2 DATASET: ~5 images with high-quality manual annotations
# - Training: 1000 iterations for precise fine-tuning
# - Higher learning rate for effective adaptation to manual annotations
# - Loads weights from Stage 1 checkpoint
