# Stage 2 Panoptic Configuration: Manual Annotations Fine-tuning
# Fine-tuning panoptic config for high-quality manual annotations
# 
# STAGE 2 DATASET: ~2 images with high-quality manual annotations  
# - Training: 400 iterations for precise fine-tuning
# - Higher learning rate for effective adaptation to manual annotations
# - Loads weights from Stage 1 panoptic checkpoint
